## PyIFSC - get Bank Details from IFSC
Get almost all details of any Indian Bank from its IFSC Code.

An experimental project to test out WebAssembly using python,
turned out as success. Basically, It Works!

page only for first load of the page based your network bandwidth.

#### Rant
Its funny, how github cannot see js and python used in the project
if not separated by file type. Basically, the Language section on
right of github repo page is blasphemous as it segregates projects
based on filetype and not actual code used.
